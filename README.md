This is the code repository for our project about *expressive AMT* which is published in the paper 

Falk, Simon; Sturm, Bob L.T. and Ahlb√§ck, Sven, "Automatic Legato Transcription based on Onset Detection", in Proceedings of the 20th Sound and Music Computing Conference, June 12-17, 2023.

- The *slurtest* dataset that we created can be found on [this page](https://www.kth.se/profile/bobs/page/research-data)

- For an overview and a demo of our legato transcription system, go to this [notebook](demo.ipynb).

## Repository description

[To be extended]

- `flow.ipynb` was used to train the model for articulated onset detection.

- `cnn-analysis.ipynb` was used to analyze the performance and training process of the models.

- `data-analysis.ipynb` was used to analyze the training dataset and provide a summary of the data used.
